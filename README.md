This project is part of the curriculum from The Odin Project, specifically the "HTML and CSS" section. It involved building a simple landing page using HTML and CSS.

What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in the following areas:

HTML Structure: I learned how to structure a web page using semantic HTML elements, such as <header>, <div>, <button>, <img>, and <footer>. This helps improve accessibility and maintainability.
CSS Styling: I practiced applying CSS styles to different elements, including fonts, colors, backgrounds, borders, and spacing. I also learned about CSS selectors, classes, and IDs to target specific elements.
Flexbox Layout: I learned how to utilize Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts. With Flexbox, I can easily align, distribute, and reorder elements within containers, making it easier to create responsive designs.
Git and GitHub: I practiced using Git for version control and GitHub for project collaboration. This allowed me to track changes, commit my work, and publish the project to a remote repository.

Project Takeaways

The "Landing Page" project provided me with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. It taught me how to structure web pages, style them effectively, and create visually appealing designs.

By completing this project, I gained practical knowledge and skills that will be valuable in future web development endeavors. I am excited to continue building upon what I learned and applying these concepts to more complex projects.
