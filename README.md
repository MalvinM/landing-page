This project is part of the curriculum from The Odin Project, specifically the "HTML and CSS" section. It involved building a simple landing page using HTML and CSS.

What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in the following areas:

HTML Structure, CSS Styling, Flexbox Layout, Git and GitHub

Project Takeaways

The "Landing Page" project provided me with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. It taught me how to structure web pages, style them effectively, and create visually appealing designs.

By completing this project, I gained practical knowledge and skills that will be valuable in future web development endeavors. I am excited to continue building upon what I learned and applying these concepts to more complex projects.
